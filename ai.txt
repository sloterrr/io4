logos

The logo I envision is a graphic that features the theme of "??" (Tea Talk) in the shape of a traditional tea cup filled with a mix of tea and milk. The liquid inside the cup represents the smooth texture of our milk tea. The overall shape of the graphic is rounded and fluid, conveying a sense of elegance and sophistication. Above the graphic, I would like the brand name "??" (Tea Talk) in simplified Chinese characters, using a simple and elegant Kai-style font to highlight our cultural roots and high-end image. Below the graphic, I would like the English name "Tea Talk" in a modern and streamlined font to convey our brand's youthful and trendy vibe. For the colors, we could use soft yellow and pale pink to convey our brand's gentle and feminine qualities, as well as light green to highlight the tea leaves. Overall, this logo will represent our brand image as modern Chinese, elegant, high-end, youthful, and trendy, attracting our target customers of young women, college students, and working professionals." --v 4 - Remix by @X- (fast, stealth)
